# seattle-times-paywall-remover
Simple Chrome extension to remove/bypass the client-side paywall on the Seattle Times website.

Complaints from The Seattle Times pushed Google to remove this extension from the Google Chrome Store,
but nothing this extension does is illegal. The only way to use this extension is manually.

Simply clone or download this entire project, navigate to chrome://extensions, activate
"developer mode," choose "load unpacked," navigate to the directory with these files, and select/load.
